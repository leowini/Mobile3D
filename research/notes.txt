Feature Detection:
This detects important parts (features) of an image
 - ORB - very good detection
 - FAST - like the name says, fast

2D Lucas Kanade (LK) tracker:
This finds feature correspondences between images.
Note: a subset of detected ORB features is chosen for tracking. A grid-based filtering is applied: an image is divided into cells, and the feature with the highest Shi-Tomasi response is taken from each cell.
